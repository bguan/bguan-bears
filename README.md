# Starlette API Server to Classify Bears

Following Lesson 2 of FastAI Course1 v3... Just playing with dockerized Starlette ASGI server that can classify an image as Black, Grizzly or Teddy bear.

Either:
 * Point browser at https://bguan-bears.now.sh and upload photo or URL pointing to photo and submit.  Or...
 * Programmatically hit the HTTP API directly.  See example below...
